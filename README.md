# NoIP Update
Python script to update NoIP hostname

### Usage

1. Open the Config.sample.py file and configure hostname, username and password.
2. Rename Config.sample.py in Config.py
3. Launch noip.py

### Advice
	
We recommend that you run the script every X minutes automatically (crontab for example) so that No-Ip.net always receives your WAN IP address.
